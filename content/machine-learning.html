<h1 class="data-cleaning-h1">Getting Started with Machine Learning</h1>

<p class="data-cleaning-paragraph">Machine Learning (ML) is a powerful branch of Artificial Intelligence that allows systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. From recommendations to fraud detection, ML is transforming industries.</p>

<h2 class="data-cleaning-h2">Key Concepts in Machine Learning</h2>

<ul class="data-cleaning-ul">
  <li class="data-cleaning-li"><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> The algorithm learns from labeled data to predict outcomes.</li>
  <li class="data-cleaning-li"><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> The model finds hidden patterns in data without predefined labels.</li>
  <li class="data-cleaning-li"><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> The system learns through rewards and penalties in a dynamic environment.</li>
  <li class="data-cleaning-li"><strong>Model Training:</strong> The process of feeding data into an algorithm to make it smarter over time.</li>
</ul>

<p class="data-cleaning-paragraph">Understanding these core areas helps in building strong foundations before diving into model creation or deployment.</p>

<h2 class="data-cleaning-h2">Beginner Tips</h2>
<p class="data-cleaning-paragraph">Just getting started with Machine Learning?</p>
<ol class="data-cleaning-ol">
  <li class="data-cleaning-li">Learn Python and explore libraries like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.</li>
  <li class="data-cleaning-li">Start with small datasets and basic algorithms like Linear Regression or KNN.</li>
  <li class="data-cleaning-li">Work on real-world projects and participate in Kaggle competitions to gain experience.</li>
</ol>

<p class="data-cleaning-paragraph">With time, you'll grasp how machines can uncover insights, classify objects, detect anomalies, and even understand language!</p>
